Problem Statement
Problem:
Given a cryptarithm (e.g., SEND + MORE = MONEY), where each letter represents a unique digit (0â€“9), find a valid assignment of digits such that the arithmetic operation holds true.
Constraints include:

No two letters have the same digit.

Numbers cannot start with digit 0.

The project uses a heuristic, probabilistic approach (randomized search with local improvements) to solve cryptarithm puzzles using techniques resembling a genetic algorithm.
